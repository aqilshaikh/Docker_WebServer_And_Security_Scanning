DevOps Deployment Task: Dockerized Application with Security and Redundancy
Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a Linux-based system with three Docker containers:

Database Container (PostgreSQL)
Web Server Container (Nginx)
Application Container (Django)
The solution ensures redundancy, self-restoration, and proper initialization sequencing, adhering to DevOps best practices. Security scanning tools and automated health monitoring are integrated into the deployment pipeline for added robustness.

Features
Core Functionality
Database Initialization: PostgreSQL initializes first, with data stored on an external volume.
Nginx Web Server: Provides access to the Django application.
Django Application: Executes database migrations during the initial deployment but prevents reruns during subsequent restarts.
Built-In Security
Container Scanning: Integrated tools (Trivy, Grype) for container vulnerability assessments.
DAST: Dynamic Application Security Testing via OWASP ZAP.
Network Scanning: Nmap runs as a container to identify open ports and vulnerabilities.
Redundancy and Self-Healing
Health Checks: Each container includes health checks to ensure readiness and reliability.
Restart Policies: Automatic container restarts upon failure.
Bonus Features
Monitoring: Optional integration with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics.
Wait-for-Script: Ensures proper initialization sequencing (DB → Nginx → Django).

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
A Linux-based system with:
Docker (≥ 20.10)
Docker Compose (≥ 1.29)
Internet access for downloading Docker images.
Step-by-Step Deployment
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/aqilshaikh/Docker_WebServer_And_Security_Scanning.git
cd Docker_WebServer_And_Security_Scanning
Run Deployment Script
Execute the setup script to install Docker, deploy the containers, and initiate the services:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
Verify the Deployment

Access the application: http://localhost
Confirm container health using:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker ps
Run Security Scans
Key Configuration Details
Database (PostgreSQL)
Data Persistence:
Data is stored in the external volume db_data to ensure durability.

Health Check:
Monitors database readiness using pg_isready.

Nginx
Configured to serve as a reverse proxy to the Django application.
Django
Runs database migrations during the first deployment using wait-for-it.sh.
Prevents re-execution of migrations on restarts.
Integrated Security Scans
Tools Used
Tool	Purpose	Output Location
Trivy	Container vulnerability scanning	./reports/trivy.log
Grype	Container image scanning	./reports/grype.log
OWASP ZAP	DAST for web application security	./reports/zap.log
Nmap	Network vulnerability scanning	./reports/nmap.log
Monitoring (Optional)
Integrate with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time health and performance metrics:

Start monitoring containers:
Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000.
Validation
Functional Testing:

Verify all containers are running:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker ps
Confirm application access: http://localhost
Security Testing:
Review scan reports in the reports/ directory for vulnerabilities.

Redundancy Check:

Stop a container and observe its automatic restart:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker stop nginx
docker ps
FAQs
1. How to restart the services?
Run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
2. How to clean up the deployment?
Use the cleanup script to remove all containers, images, and volumes:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x cleanup.sh
./cleanup.sh
