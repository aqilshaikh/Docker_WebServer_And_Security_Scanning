## Tasks and Details

### Task 1: Web Server Deployment

- **Objective**: Deploy a secure and scalable web server.
- **Key Files**:
  - `deployment.yaml`: Deployment configuration for Docker Compose.
  - `setup.sh`: Shell script for setting up the environment.
  - `start.yml`: Ansible playbook to start services.

---

### Task 2: Monitoring and Security Scanning

- **Objective**: Implement monitoring and security scanning solutions.
- **Key Files**:
  - `deployment.yaml`: Deployment configuration for Docker Compose.
  - `monitoring-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file for monitoring stack.
  - `nginx.conf`: Hardened Nginx configuration file.
  - `prometheus.yml`: Prometheus configuration file.
  - `setup.sh`: Shell script for environment setup.
  - `start.yaml`: Ansible playbook for service initiation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aqilshaikh/Docker_WebServer_And_Security_Scanning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired task folder:
   ```bash
   cd Docker_WebServer_And_Security_Scanning-main/Task_1
   ```
3. Execute the setup script:
   ```bash
   bash setup.sh
   ```

For detailed steps, refer to the README files within each task folder.

---

## Security Highlights

- **Nginx Configuration**: Hardened server configuration with minimal attack surface.
- **Prometheus Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of metrics and alerts.
- **Security Scanning Tools**: Automated scans with tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Container Isolation**: Docker Compose ensures each service is isolated, reducing risks.

---

## Tools Used

- **Docker Compose**: For orchestrating multi-container applications.
- **Nginx**: As a web server with security hardening.
- **Prometheus**: For monitoring and alerting.
